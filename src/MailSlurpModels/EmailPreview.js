/**
 * MailSlurp API
 * Send and receive email from ephemeral email addresses via REST. Test email signup, verification codes, transactional-mail and more.  ### About [MailSlurp](https://www.mailslurp.com/) is a SAAS API for sending and receiving emails from ephemeral email inboxes. These inboxes can be created on the fly and each has a unique email address.  ### Why MailSlurp was built for **testing software or processes that interact with email in some way**. For more information see the [homepage](https://www.mailslurp.com/).  ### Links  - [Create an account](https://app.mailslurp.com/) - [Get API Key](https://app.mailslurp.com/) - [API Documentation](https://docs.mailslurp.com/) - [Official SDK Libraries](https://github.com/mailslurp) - [Support](https://www.mailslurp.com/#support) / [Issues](mailto:contact@mailslurp.com) - [Swagger JSON](https://swagger.mailslurp.com/)   ### Usage **Recommended** There is a hand written [Javascript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mailslurp-client) with Typescript support. It is [published on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mailslurp-client) and is the recommended client. However if you don't want to use it see the generated SDKs below in other languages.  - `npm install mailslurp-client`  See NPM package for [more information](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mailslurp-client).  **HTTP API** You can call the MailSlurp API from any HTTP client in any language. HTTP endpoints are [documented here](https://docs.mailslurp.com).  **Other official SDKs** Or you use one of the official generated [SDK Libraries](https://github.com/mailslurp).  - [Official Typescript SDK](https://github.com/mailslurp/swagger-sdk-typescript-fetch) - [Official Python SDK](https://github.com/mailslurp/swagger-sdk-python) - [Official C# SDK](https://github.com/mailslurp/swagger-sdk-csharp) - [Official Java SDK](https://github.com/mailslurp/swagger-sdk-java) - [Official Swift SDK](https://github.com/mailslurp/swagger-sdk-swift) - [Official Golang SDK](https://github.com/mailslurp/swagger-sdk-go) - [Official Javascript SDK](https://github.com/mailslurp/swagger-sdk-javascript) - [Official PHP SDK](https://github.com/mailslurp/swagger-sdk-php) - [Official Ruby SDK](https://github.com/mailslurp/swagger-sdk-ruby)  **Custom SDKs** You can also compile your own library with SwaggerCodegen and the [Swagger Spec](https://swagger.mailslurp.com).  **Demo application** Lastly, there is an interactive GUI available at [demo.mailslurp.com](https://demo.mailslurp.com/) for testing requests.  ### Authentication An [API Key](#authentication) must be passed as a header in all requests. To get an API Key [sign up](https://app.mailslurp.com/sign-up) and log in to the [MailSlurp Dashboard](https://app.mailslurp.com/) web app.  > Use `test` as an API Key when using the demo application.  ### Terminology - [Inbox](#/definitions/InboxDto)     - A unique email address     - Unlimited in number     - Can send and receive emails - [Email](#/definitions/Email)     - Belongs to an inbox     - Contains summary and body     - Raw content stored on S3  ### Example operation - Before you send or receive an email you need to create an inbox - It is recommended to create a new empty inbox for each test case run - The inbox email address is returned with the response for the GetInbox and CreateInbox operations. - You can send an email (from your application or MailSlurp) to that address and it will be saved in the matching inbox - To get the email, ListEmails in the inbox and get a list of the current emails. Then GetEmail by the id given. - Emails are asynchronous so **it is highly recommended to use the minCount** parameter when using ListEmails so that MailSlurp retries the database until your expected count is met. This means you should increase your request timeout accordingly.   ### Support **Issues** If you encounter issues please [contact the developers](mailto:contact@mailslurp.com) or open a ticket in [GitHub](https://www.github.com/mailslurp).  **Contact** Please contact MailSlurp at any time via [the support page](https://www.mailslurp.com/#support).
